# Note
This is a very simple app that I made for myself but decided to add here in case it's helpful to someone else ðŸ™‚. It wasn't extensively tested on different sensors or HomeKit accessories. If you find a bug feel free to add an issue. Although I'm not planning to spend too much time supporting this app, PRs are welcome :)
